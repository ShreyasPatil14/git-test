1.  git init : to initialize local project folder as a git repo.
2.  git clone <https link> : to copy/download remote repo in our local machine. 
3.  ls -hidden : to see all files including .git
4.  git status: to check whether file is...
            1. untracked : new file which is not in remote repo but in local folder (newly created at local folder).
            2. modified  : file present in both local and remote repo but is updated at local repo.
                           (file is one step forward than the remote repo).
            3. staged    : file  is added (add) or ready to commit.
            4. unmodified: file is commited (up to date).
5.  git add <file name> : add a particular file.
6.  git add .           : add all changes.
7.  git commit -m "message" : commit changes with message.
8.  git push origin main    : push/upload local folder to github.
                              ( origin: default name of cloned repo, main: main branch).
                              ( first type [git push -u origin main] to use shortcut as [git push] for every next push operation)
9.  git remote add origin <https link> : to add/upload local folder to git repo.
10. git remote -v : to verify remote (git repo)

11. git branch : to check current branch.
11. git branch -M <new name> : to change name of branch.
12. git checkout -b <new branch name> : to create new branch.
13. git checkout <other branch name> : navigate to other branch.
14. git branch -d <branch name> : delete a branch. (go to other branch then delete current one)
15. git push origin <branch name> : push new branch on github.
16. git diff <other branch name> : compare current branch with other branch.
17. git merge <other branch name> : merge current branch with the other branch.
                                    (resolve merging conflicts manualy then push).
18. git pull origin main : update local repo w.r.t github repo. (after successfully merging branches [PR]).
19. git reset <filename> OR git reset (for all) : to undo staged(add) changes.
20. git reset HEAD~1 : undo one commit change.
21. git reset <comimit hash> : undo multiple commits.
                               (git log : to see all hash of each commit).
22. git reset --hard <commit hash> : reflect changes to local repo.



# craete a project folder on local machine and push it on the github:
i.      initialize folder with .git file : git init
ii.     add changes : git add .
iii.    commit changes : git commit -m "message" 
iv.     #create a github repo on github and copy the https link. 
v.      link the remote repo with local repo : git remote add origin <https link>
vi.     verify the remote : git remote -v
vi.     check branch name : git branch
viii.   bydefault the current branch is "master" so rename it as a "main" : git branch -M main
ix.     now push the code on remote repo : git push origin main
        

# general workflow :
create github repo -> clone -> <work> -> add -> commit -> push
